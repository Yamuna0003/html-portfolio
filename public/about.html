<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my corner of the web! My name is Yamuna, and 
  I'm passionate about website development and creating engaging online experiences.
  Currently a college student diving deep into the world of web development, 
  I'm exploring the intersection of design and functionality to craft intuitive and visually appealing websites.
</p>

<p>My journey began with a curiosity about how websites work and has evolved into a fascination with coding languages 
  like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
  I believe in the power of the web to connect people, share ideas, and make information accessible to everyone.
</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I enjoy experimenting with different design techniques and user interfaces to enhance the user experience.
   Every project is an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to share my progress and insights with you here.
